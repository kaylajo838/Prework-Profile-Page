                            enrolled in a full stack web development bootcamp with Coding Temple. I will be continuously
                            learning throughout my entire career. I don't plan on stopping learning after I graduate
                            bootcamp. I will be consistently learning and building up my skillsets, no matter how many
                            years I am in the industry and what careers I end up being in.

                    <p>
                        My name is Kayla Imming. I was born and raised in Spokane, WA. I am raising two handsome boys.
                        My
                        family
                        means everything to me. I have many different hobbies to keep me occupied in any spare time I
                        have.
                        Those
                        hobbies include:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Cooking</li>
                        <li>Baking</li>
                        <li>Playing Video Games</li>
                        <li>Building Motorcycles</li>
                        <li>Building Race Cars</li>
                        <li>Going to Concerts</li>
                        <li>Photography</li>
                        <li>Modeling</li>
                        <li>Working Out</li>
                        <li>Rescuing/Rehabilitating Animals</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        I decided to I wanted to learn how to code after playing years of video games, and getting
                        interested in
                        wondering how the code worked to come together to build these games. I used to be interested in
                        the
                        medical
                        field. I used to have aspirations to become a nurse. Before college, I decided to be a CNA to
                        help
                        my
                        career
                        path. After being around so much death and witnessing a lot of neglect, I decided on a career
                        change.
                        That
                        was the best decision I could have made for myself. The complexity behind coding has my mind
                        constantly
                        turning, and has been exactly what I wanted it to be.
